    "## Steps Overview\n",
    "1. Define an Agent with a role, goal, and the LLM model it will use.\n",
    "2. Define a Task that associates a description and expected output to the agent.\n",

    "4. Kickoff the Crew with an input query and observe the response.\n",

    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- Install the `crewai` library.\n",
